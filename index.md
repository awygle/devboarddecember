## Dev Board December

Dev Board December is an [impromptu event](https://twitter.com/awygle/status/1333923834194325504) where I, and many generous members of the FPGA community, donate development boards to help improve access to FPGAs as a field for those who don't feel they can afford to invest the money.

For 2020 and most of 2021, this page will be used solely to host the documentation and the latest status update, however I hope to use it to repeat the event in December 2021.

### Latest Status Update

I have reached out to everyone who I know for sure will get a board, including the FOMU boards. Most of the ULX3S and iCEBreaker boards have been ordered (with Crowd Supply generously covering shipping) and some have already been delivered. International orders for those boards have been placed and are being processed - some, but not all, have shipped out. I have received the FOMU boards and am collecting delivery addresses now. Once I have (most of) those delivery addresses I will begin figuring out the best way to ship them, given the international response I received.

I am still accepting donations to help with shipping or sending out more boards - please contact me on Twitter or Discord as @awygle for PayPal details. Once I have figured out shipping for the current batch of FOMU boards, I will know if there is any money left over to be used to send out additional boards.

## Documentation

As getting started documentation for the matrix of (dev board, operating system) is completed, I will post links here. All documentation will use the open source tool flow, as I believe it is the simplest and most accessible way to get into FPGAs.
